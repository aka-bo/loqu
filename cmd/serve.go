	// serveCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	serveCmd.Flags().IntVarP(&options.ListenPort, "port", "p", options.ListenPort, "The port the service will bind to.")
	serveCmd.Flags().IntVarP(&options.ShutdownDelaySeconds, "shutdown-delay", "s", options.ShutdownDelaySeconds, "The amount of time in seconds to delay on shutdown. Useful for testing graceful termination.")
